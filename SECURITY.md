# RSK's Security Process

We're committed to conduct our security process in a professional and civil manner. Public shaming, under-reporting or misrepresentation of vulnerabilities will not be tolerated.

## Responsible Disclosure

For all security related issues, RSK has two main points of contact. Reach us at <security@iovlabs.org> or refer to our [Bug Bounty Program.](https://www.rsk.co/bounty-program/) **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability.**

**Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on Github under [Issues](https://github.com/rsksmart/rif-marketplace-ui/issues).

## Vulnerability Handling

### Response Time

RSK will make a best effort to meet the following response times for reported vulnerabilities:

* Time to first response (from report submit) - 24 hours
* Time to triage (from report submit) - 2 business days
* Time to bounty (from triage) - 15 business days

Weâ€™ll try to keep you informed about our progress throughout the process.

### Disclouse Policy

* Follow HackerOne's [disclosure guidelines](https://www.hackerone.com/disclosure-guidelines).
* Public disclosure of a vulnerability makes it ineligible for a bounty. If the user reports the vulnerability to other security teams (e.g. Ethereum or ETC) but reports to RSK with considerable delay, then RSK may reduce or cancel the bounty.
